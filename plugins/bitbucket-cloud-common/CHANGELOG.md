# @backstage/plugin-bitbucket-cloud-common

## 0.1.0-next.0

### Minor Changes

- 1dffa7dd4d: Add new common library `bitbucket-cloud-common` with a client for Bitbucket Cloud.

  This client can be reused across all packages and might be the future place for additional
  features like managing the rate limits, etc.

  The client itself was generated in parts using the `@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli`.
